# TreadLight
("https://tread-light.herokuapp.com/")


## Description

TreadLight is a free application for eco-conscious individuals that are looking for ways that they can help the planet and combat CO2 emissions and climate change. CO2 is created primarily by fossil fuels and millions of gallons of fossil fuels are used daily for people to travel all over the world. Whether you are flying, driving, or traveling by train, there is a significant release of CO2 that impacts our planet. TreadLight allows users to make educated travel decisions to reduce their carbon footprint. Once users have decided how they are going to travel, they have the choice of being able to donate to offset that CO2 production. Users will be able to see their custom profile on how they have impacted the environment throughout their travels.
